# Requirements: SpecDrive AutoBuild

Version: V2.0

## 1. Background

SpecDrive AutoBuild is a spec-driven autonomous coding system for software teams. It coordinates structured product specs, reusable skills, context-isolated subagents, project memory, Codex Runner execution, dashboard state, review, recovery, and delivery reporting so AI can continuously deliver code in a controllable and auditable workflow.

## 2. Goals

- Generate structured Feature Specs from natural-language requirements.
- Select ready Feature Specs based on priority and readiness.
- Drive Feature Specs through planning, task graph generation, dashboard tracking, scheduling, implementation, validation, review, and delivery.
- Slice large work into context-isolated subagent runs with bounded scopes.
- Provide each subagent with only the minimum context required for the assigned task.
- Preserve project goals, decisions, board status, blockers, and recovery context across CLI sessions.
- Support long-running tasks, failure retries, breakpoint recovery, delivery auditing, and PR generation.

## 3. Non-Goals

- Build proprietary LLMs.
- Build a proprietary full IDE.
- Provide an enterprise-grade complex permission matrix in MVP.
- Automatically deploy to production.
- Automatically migrate complex microservice systems across multiple large repositories.
- Fully replace Jira, GitHub Issues, Linear, or equivalent issue trackers.

## 4. Actors

- User: submits natural-language requirements and reviews outcomes.
- Product Manager: provides product goals, priorities, and clarifications.
- Developer: connects repositories, reviews plans, and handles manual interventions.
- Spec Agent: creates and refines specs.
- Clarification Agent: identifies requirement gaps and asks clarification questions.
- Repo Probe Agent: collects repository context.
- Architecture Agent: proposes technical plans and risk rules.
- Task Agent: decomposes work into tasks.
- Coding Agent: performs code changes through Codex Runner.
- Test Agent: validates changes and evidence.
- Review Agent: evaluates high-risk or blocked work.
- Recovery Agent: handles failures and retry workflows.

## 5. User Stories

- As a user, I want to submit natural-language requirements so that the system can produce structured Feature Specs.
- As a product manager, I want requirements decomposed into acceptance criteria so that delivery can be evaluated objectively.
- As a developer, I want work split into bounded tasks so that autonomous coding remains reviewable and recoverable.
- As a developer, I want subagents to receive limited context so that parallel work avoids unnecessary context bloat.
- As a team lead, I want dashboards and audit logs so that I can understand progress, failures, and delivery evidence.
- As a reviewer, I want risky or failed changes routed to review so that unsafe work is not merged automatically.
