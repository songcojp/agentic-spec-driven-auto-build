# PRD: Spec-Driven Autonomous Coding System

Version: V2.0

---

## 1. Product Definition

SpecDrive AutoBuild is a long-running autonomous coding system designed for software teams. The system uses structured Spec to manage product goals and acceptance criteria, project-local CLI Skills to solidify reusable engineering methods, CLI-native Subagents to handle delegation and context transfer, Project Memory to provide persistent memory across sessions, Codex Runner to execute code modifications, testing, and fixing, and an internal task state machine to manage task flow, approval, recovery, and delivery while the Dashboard presents that state.

Core Conclusion:

```text
Spec Protocol
+ CLI Skill Directory
+ CLI Subagent Delegation
+ Project Memory
+ Codex Runner
+ Internal Task State Machine
+ Dashboard View
```

One-line Positioning:

> Enable AI to continuously deliver code within a controllable, recoverable, and auditable engineering workflow.

## 2. Product Goals

### 2.1 Core Goals

1. Automatically generate structured Feature Spec after user inputs natural language requirements.
2. Automatically select the next pending Feature Spec based on priority and readiness.
3. Automatically drive the Feature Spec pipeline: Tech Plan → Task Graph → Dashboard → Scheduling.
4. Generate technical plans, task graphs, acceptance criteria, and risk rules based on Spec.
5. Slice large tasks into schedulable tasks that can be delegated through CLI-native Subagents.
6. Record durable run, evidence, status, review, and recovery state without re-implementing CLI context slicing.
7. Codex Runner executes code modifications, testing, fixes, and PR generation.
8. Status Checker automatically determines if tasks are done, failed, blocked, or need review.
9. Dashboard displays real-time task status and delivery progress maintained by the internal task state machine.
10. System injects Project Memory per CLI session to recover goals, decisions, and blocked states.
11. Support long-running tasks, failure retries, breakpoint recovery, and delivery auditing.

### 2.2 Non-Goals

MVP does not include:
* Proprietary LLMs.
* Proprietary full IDE.
* Enterprise complex permission matrix.
* Automatic production deployment.
* Complex microservices auto-migration across multiple large repos.
* Complete replacement of Jira, GitHub Issues, or Linear.

## 4. Core Concepts

### 4.1 Spec Protocol
Internal protocol for requirements, planning, acceptance, and execution evidence. Single source of truth. Includes Product Brief, Feature Spec, Clarification Log, Checklist, Tech Plan, Task Graph, Acceptance Criteria, Evidence, etc.

### 4.2 Skill System
Reusable engineering capabilities live in project-local `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md` files. Codex CLI owns Skill discovery and invocation; SpecDrive only discovers Skill metadata for readiness checks and Console display.

### 4.3 Subagent Runtime
Subagent delegation is CLI-native. SpecDrive does not create Agent Run Contracts or context slices; it records run events, evidence, status checks, review decisions, recovery attempts, and audit history around CLI execution.

### 4.4 Project Memory
Persistent project-level memory for CLI long-running sessions, stored in `.autobuild/memory/project.md`. Injects current goals, board status snapshot, and active blockers to prevent repeated repo exploration.

### 4.5 Evidence Pack
Structured output for each Subagent Run, utilized for state judgment, approvals, and reports.

---

## 5. User Workflow
Phase 1: Project Initialization -> Phase 2: Requirement Intake -> Phase 3: Autonomous Execution Loop.
The system continuously routes through scheduling, planning, implementing, and delivery without forced human interaction unless Review Needed.

## 7. Core Data Models
Includes schemas for Project, Feature, Requirement, Task, Run, ProjectMemory, EvidencePack, Runner records, StatusCheckResult, Review, Recovery, and Audit records. Skill Registry and custom Context Broker tables are not part of the product data model.

---

## 8. Page Requirements
UI requirements for Dashboard, Spec Workspace, Skill Center, Subagent Console, Board, Runner Console, and Review Center. Skill Center reads project-local Skill files; Subagent Console reads durable run, event, evidence, and status-check records.

---

## 9. Non-Functional Requirements
* **Security**: Sandbox-first, no bypasses, rollback capability.
* **Stability**: Idempotent runs, recovery from crashes.
* **Observability**: Timelines, audit logs, cost/success tracking.
* **Performance**: Board loading < 2s, Evidence write < 3s, parallel Subagents support.

---

## 10. Success Metrics
Targeting >85% for Spec Generation/Decomposition, >60% autonomous low-risk task completion, and 100% PR generation/traceability.

---

## 11. MVP Version Planning
* **M1**: Spec Protocol + CLI Skill Discovery
* **M2**: Plan + Task Graph + Feature Selector
* **M3**: CLI Subagent Observation + Project Memory
* **M4**: Codex Runner
* **M5**: Status Check & Recovery

## 12. Risks & Mitigations
Addressed context bloat, memory staleness, parallel worktree conflicts, prompt drift, and continuous failure loops.

---

## 13. Final Conclusion
SpecDrive AutoBuild V2.0 operates on the principle:
> Spec prevents drifting, Skill provides ability, Subagent prevents context bloat, Memory prevents amnesia, Runner executes, and Dashboard manages.
