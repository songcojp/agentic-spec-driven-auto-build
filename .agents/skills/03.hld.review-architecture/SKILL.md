# Architecture Plan Skill

Use this skill to turn feature requirements into an implementable technical plan.

## Workflow

1. Read feature requirements, feature design, project HLD, technical context, and research decisions.
2. Define feature components, ownership boundaries, integration points, state changes, error handling, and observability.
3. Preserve project-level architecture decisions; do not redefine the HLD.
4. Identify files or modules expected to change and which parts must remain untouched.
5. Note design gaps that block implementation or task slicing.

## Output

- Feature architecture plan.
- Component and module boundaries.
- State, error, recovery, and audit behavior.
- Implementation constraints and risks.

## Output Contract

- Follow `.agents/skills/SKILL_OUTPUT_CONTRACT.md` and return exactly one `SkillOutputContractV1` JSON object.
- `summary` must state whether the architecture plan is ready for data model / contract planning or blocked.
- `result` must follow the specialized contract below.

## Specialized Result Contract

`result` should contain:

- `components`: array of planned components/modules and ownership boundaries.
- `integrationPoints`: array of APIs, events, files, adapters, or UI surfaces involved.
- `stateAndRecovery`: state, error, recovery, and audit behavior summary.
- `constraints`: implementation constraints that downstream tasks must preserve.
- `risks`: array of risks with mitigation or required routing.

## Failure Routing

- Use `clarification_needed` for missing acceptance or unclear workflow.
- Use `risk_review_needed` for broad shared-module or architecture impact.
