# Requirements Checklist Skill

Use this skill as the readiness gate for requirements.

## Workflow

1. Confirm every requirement is atomic, observable, testable, and traceable to PRD or approved source references.
2. Check that acceptance criteria can become tests without interpretation.
3. Verify error, empty, duplicate, permission, timeout, recovery, and concurrency paths where relevant.
4. Confirm open questions are either resolved or explicitly block readiness.
5. Report requirement IDs that are missing design, task, or feature coverage.

## Output

- Pass/fail readiness decision.
- Requirement gaps by ID.
- Missing acceptance checks.
- Required clarification or risk-review routing.

## Output Contract

- Follow `.agents/skills/SKILL_OUTPUT_CONTRACT.md` and return exactly one `SkillOutputContractV1` JSON object.
- `summary` must state pass/fail readiness and the most important blocking gaps.
- `result` must follow the specialized contract below.

## Specialized Result Contract

`result` should contain:

- `decision`: `"pass"` or `"fail"`.
- `gaps`: array of requirement gaps by ID.
- `missingAcceptanceChecks`: array of missing or untestable checks.
- `traceabilityFindings`: requirement/source/feature traceability issues.
- `requiredRouting`: `"none"`, `"clarification_needed"`, or `"risk_review_needed"`.

## Failure Routing

- Use `clarification_needed` for untestable or conflicting requirements.
- Use `risk_review_needed` when readiness gaps affect architecture, data, security, or active implementation.
