# SkillOutputContractV1

Project-local skills may stream `SkillOutputContractV1` JSON objects while invoked by the Scheduler, CLI Adapter, RPC Adapter, or Execution Workbench. The final result must be the last valid `SkillOutputContractV1` object in the stream.

The common contract is optimized for the Execution Workbench display:

- `contractVersion`: always `"skill-contract/v1"`.
- `executionId`: echo the invocation `executionId`.
- `skillSlug`: echo the invocation `skillSlug`.
- `requestedAction`: echo the invocation `requestedAction`.
- `status`: one of `"queued"`, `"running"`, `"waiting_input"`, `"approval_needed"`, `"review_needed"`, `"blocked"`, `"failed"`, `"cancelled"`, or `"completed"`.
- `summary`: concise human-readable execution summary. This is shown in Current Execution and Result Projection, so it must state the outcome, not only the process.
- `nextAction`: the recommended next scheduler/operator action as a string, or `null` when no follow-up is needed.
- `producedArtifacts`: every created, updated, unchanged, missing, or skipped expected artifact. Each item must include `path`, `kind`, `status`, `checksum` (`string` or `null`), and `summary` (`string` or `null`).
- `traceability`: include only Feature-level traceability with `featureId`. Do not include `requirementIds`, `taskId`, `changeIds`, or task/package-level tracking in the common Skill output contract.
- `result`: skill-specific machine-readable execution result. Use `{}` only when the skill has no specialized result fields.

Do not add extra top-level fields. Put command output, verification details, decisions, blockers, coverage, and execution results in `summary`, `producedArtifacts[].summary`, `nextAction`, or `result`.

## Common vs Specialized Result Boundary

The common `SkillOutputContractV1.traceability` field intentionally stays small:
it carries only `featureId`. Requirement IDs, task IDs, acceptance rows, journey
checkpoints, test commands, screenshots, PR links, and review decisions belong
in the skill-specific `result` object or produced artifact summaries.

For `07.execution.dispatch-adapter` with `requestedAction =
"feature_execution"`, `status = "completed"` is valid only when `result`
contains all of the following closure evidence:

- `requirementCoverage`: non-empty coverage rows for the implemented
  requirements.
- `acceptanceEvidence`: non-empty acceptance scenario evidence.
- `journeyEvidence`: non-empty user story or Journey Checkpoint evidence.
- `gitDelivery`: Feature Git lifecycle evidence, including owner workspace,
  implementation workspace or approved fallback, worktree, branch, commit hash,
  PR URL, checks, merge, remote branch cleanup, local branch cleanup, and
  worktree cleanup.

A foundation-only Feature may omit direct journey evidence only when
`result.foundationExemption` is present and includes:

- `exempt: true`
- `reason`
- `downstreamFeatures`
- `integrationEvidence`

Passing tests, creating a commit, opening a PR, or marking tasks done is not by
itself enough for a completed feature execution. Missing or failed journey
closure evidence must produce `review_needed` with `journey_not_closed`,
`acceptance_gap`, or `evidence_missing`. Missing or incomplete Git delivery
evidence must produce `review_needed`, `approval_needed`, or `blocked` with
`delivery_evidence_missing` or `delivery_not_closed`.

Closure fields must be direct structured arrays on `result`, and `gitDelivery`
must be a direct structured object on `result`. Do not provide them only as
prose in `result.details`, `result.items`, report summaries, or produced
artifact summaries; the Journey Closure Gate and Git Delivery Gate do not parse
prose evidence.

Use `status = "queued"` before execution starts, `status = "running"` while reading, analyzing, writing, or verifying, `status = "waiting_input"` when user information is required, and `status = "approval_needed"` when command, permission, or risk approval is required. Final status must be `completed`, `review_needed`, `blocked`, `failed`, or `cancelled`. Use `status = "completed"` when the skill produced a valid decision or artifact, even if the decision is "none" or "no change". Use `status = "blocked"` for missing inputs or unresolved required decisions, `status = "review_needed"` only when a real human or risk review gate must resolve the next step, and include the review reason in `summary` or `result.reviewNeededReason`. Use `status = "failed"` for execution errors that prevented a valid skill result.

Do not return shorthand JSON such as `{"summary": "...", "status": "...", "evidence": [...]}`. Any progress or final response must be the complete contract object below, with invocation-owned execution fields echoed exactly. Progress objects must not use `review_needed` as a placeholder for work in progress.
