# Repo Probe Skill

Use this skill for bounded read-only exploration.

## Workflow

1. Define the exact question, feature, module, or file set to probe.
2. Use fast local search such as `rg`, `rg --files`, `git status`, `git log`, and targeted file reads.
3. Identify relevant files, existing patterns, tests, commands, and constraints.
4. Avoid speculative implementation advice beyond the probe question.
5. Report confidence and any gaps that require deeper inspection.

## Output

- Source-backed repository facts.
- Relevant paths and commands.
- Existing conventions to reuse.
- Unknowns or risks.

## Output Contract

- Follow `.agents/skills/SKILL_OUTPUT_CONTRACT.md` and return exactly one `SkillOutputContractV1` JSON object.
- `summary` must state the source-backed repository facts gathered and any unresolved unknowns.
- `result` must follow the specialized contract below.

## Specialized Result Contract

`result` should contain:

- `facts`: array of source-backed facts with file/path references.
- `paths`: relevant files, directories, or modules.
- `commands`: commands discovered for build, test, dev, or verification.
- `conventions`: implementation patterns to reuse.
- `unknowns`: unresolved questions or risks.

## Failure Routing

- Use `clarification_needed` when the probe target is too broad or ambiguous.
