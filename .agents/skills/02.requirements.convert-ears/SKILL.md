# PR EARS Requirement Decomposition Skill

This is the design-named PRD-to-EARS conversion entry point.

## Workflow

1. Locate the source PRD, product request, PR/RP, or feature brief. If no path is given, prefer root project docs first: `docs/PRD.md`, then `docs/requirements.md` when the PRD has already been decomposed. Only use localized lanes such as `docs/en/PRD.md`, `docs/zh-CN/PRD.md`, or `docs/ja/PRD.md` when the project explicitly declares multilingual documentation (for example `docs/README.md` lists languages/default language) or the invocation provides a localized source path.
2. Preserve the source language unless the user asks for another language.
3. Extract product goals, non-goals, actors, user stories, functional requirements, non-functional requirements, risks, constraints, and unresolved questions. Ensure Project Initialization (项目初始化) is extracted as a distinct baseline requirement.
4. **Extract and prioritize user stories** before converting to EARS statements:
   - Identify each distinct user journey or independently deliverable capability from the PRD.
   - Assign a priority level: `P1` (Core—must ship), `P2` (important—should ship), `P3` (nice to have).
   - Verify each user story is independently testable and delivers standalone value.
   - Include a foundational user story or requirement for Project Initialization (项目初始化) (e.g., scaffolding, environment setup, base dependencies) if not explicitly present.
   - Record stories as `US-001`, `US-002`, ... with title, actor, goal, and priority.
5. Convert observable behavior into EARS statements using stable IDs:
   - `REQ-001`, `REQ-002`, ... for functional requirements.
   - `NFR-001`, `NFR-002`, ... for non-functional requirements.
   - `EDGE-001`, `EDGE-002`, ... for boundary, error, recovery, or exceptional paths.
   - Map each `REQ-*` back to the `US-*` it belongs to.
6. Keep each requirement atomic, observable, testable, and free of implementation choices unless the source states a hard constraint.
7. Add traceability back to PRD sections or source bullets when possible.
8. Surface gaps as open questions instead of inventing product intent.
9. Write only the EARS requirements output directly to the requested file using normal file-edit/write tools. If the user does not specify a target, create or update `docs/requirements.md`. Write to a localized `docs/<language>/requirements.md` only when the project explicitly declares multilingual documentation or the invocation explicitly requests that localized lane.
10. Do not split product scope into Feature Specs, create `docs/features/<feature-id>/` packages, update `docs/features/README.md`, or push anything into the Feature Spec Pool. Feature splitting belongs to `05.feature.decompose`.
11. Treat `ARTIFACT: <relative-path>` fallback content as a last-resort only when direct file writes fail; do not use ARTIFACT output as the normal path.

## EARS Patterns

Use the simplest pattern that fits the behavior:

```markdown
WHEN [event or trigger]
THE SYSTEM SHALL [observable expected behavior]

WHILE [state or mode]
THE SYSTEM SHALL [observable expected behavior]

IF [optional feature or configuration is enabled]
THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL [observable expected behavior]

WHERE [context or actor scope applies]
THE SYSTEM SHALL [observable expected behavior]

WHEN [unwanted condition or error occurs]
THE SYSTEM SHALL [safe handling, error message, rollback, retry, or blocked action]
```

## Output

- User story index (`US-*`) with priority (P1/P2/P3) and independent-testability confirmation.
- Atomic EARS requirements mapped to their parent `US-*`.
- Non-functional requirements and edge cases.
- Traceability matrix (requirement → PRD section → user story).
- Open questions for unresolved product intent.
- No Feature Spec package, task graph, or Feature Spec index output.
- Return a `SkillOutputContractV1` JSON object with `contractVersion`, `executionId`, `skillSlug`, `requestedAction`, `status`, `summary`, `producedArtifacts`, and Feature-level `traceability`.

## Output Contract

- Follow `.agents/skills/SKILL_OUTPUT_CONTRACT.md` and return exactly one `SkillOutputContractV1` JSON object.
- `summary` must state how many user stories, requirements, NFRs, edge cases, and open questions were produced.
- `result` must follow the specialized contract below.

## Specialized Result Contract

`result` should contain:

- `userStories`: array of `US-*` IDs with priority and independent-testability status.
- `requirements`: array of produced `REQ-*` IDs grouped by parent user story.
- `nonFunctionalRequirements`: array of produced `NFR-*` IDs.
- `edgeCases`: array of produced `EDGE-*` IDs.
- `openQuestions`: array of unresolved product-intent questions.
- `traceabilityMatrix`: compact mapping from requirement ID to source section and user story.

## Quality Bar

- Every requirement has exactly one primary behavior.
- Every requirement can become a test case without interpretation.
- Defined `US-*`, `REQ-*`, `NFR-*`, and `EDGE-*` IDs are unique and monotonically increasing within their section; update traceability references if an ID changes.
- Error, empty, permission, duplicate, timeout, and recovery paths are covered when relevant.
- Design, data model, framework, database, and algorithm choices stay out of requirements unless explicitly required by the source.
- Ambiguity is captured in `Open Questions` with the smallest useful question.

## Failure Routing

- Use `clarification_needed` for ambiguous goals, conflicting sources, or untestable acceptance.
