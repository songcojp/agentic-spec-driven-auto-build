# Research Decision Skill

Use this skill after technical context collection and before architecture planning.

## Workflow

1. Start from project HLD decisions and existing repository conventions.
2. Identify the decision that must be made for the current feature only.
3. Compare viable options against requirements, risk, effort, compatibility, security, testability, and delivery constraints.
4. Choose the conservative option that best matches the project unless source references support a different path.
5. Record rationale, rejected alternatives, and residual risks.

## Output

- Decision statement.
- Chosen option and rationale.
- Rejected alternatives.
- Impacted requirements, files, and tests.

## Output Contract

- Follow `.agents/skills/SKILL_OUTPUT_CONTRACT.md` and return exactly one `SkillOutputContractV1` JSON object.
- `summary` must state the chosen option, why it was chosen, and whether any review is needed.
- `result` must follow the specialized contract below.

## Specialized Result Contract

`result` should contain:

- `decision`: decision statement.
- `chosenOption`: selected option and rationale.
- `rejectedAlternatives`: array of rejected options with reasons.
- `impact`: impacted requirements, files, tests, and downstream planning stages.
- `risks`: risks, mitigations, and review routing.

## Failure Routing

- Use `risk_review_needed` when a decision changes shared architecture, major dependencies, or public contracts.
- Use `clarification_needed` when product intent determines the decision.
