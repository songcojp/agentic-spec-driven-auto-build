# Test Execution Skill

Use this skill to produce trustworthy verification summaries.

## Workflow

1. Read the task or feature acceptance criteria and the repository's test/build commands.
2. Select the narrowest command that proves the changed behavior; broaden only when risk requires it.
3. Run tests from the correct worktree and runtime environment.
4. Classify failures as product mismatch, implementation bug, environment issue, flaky test, missing fixture, or spec gap.
5. Attach command, exit status, and concise output summary to the result.

## Output

- Commands run and results.
- Failure classification.
- Status Checker summary.
- Recommended next action.

## Output Contract

- Follow `.agents/skills/SKILL_OUTPUT_CONTRACT.md` and return exactly one `SkillOutputContractV1` JSON object.
- `summary` must state commands run, pass/fail state, failure classification, and recommended next action.
- `result` must follow the specialized contract below.

## Specialized Result Contract

`result` should contain:

- `commands`: array with command, cwd, exitCode, status, and concise output summary.
- `failureClassification`: failure category or `null`.
- `statusChecker`: status checker decision and reasons.
- `artifacts`: logs, screenshots, reports, or evidence paths.
- `recommendedNextAction`: recovery, review, rerun, broaden tests, or no action.

## Failure Routing

- Use `12.recovery.classify-failure` for recoverable implementation or test failures.
- Use `blocked` for missing environment or unavailable external dependency.
- Use `risk_review_needed` when verification is insufficient for a high-risk change.
