# Behavior Verification

## Workflow

1. Confirm the requested outcome, source artifacts, workspace root, and allowed scope.
2. Read referenced files from disk and pass paths, IDs, and section anchors instead of pasted document bodies.
3. Apply this skill's workflow only to its declared responsibility; route adjacent lifecycle work to another project skill.
4. Produce or review the requested artifacts with traceability to PRD, requirements, HLD, Feature Spec, execution records, tests, or evidence as applicable.
5. Return the runtime-supplied structured output shape exactly. Echo `executionId`, `skillName`, `requestedAction`, produced artifacts, next action, and Feature-level traceability when the adapter provides them.

## Guidance

Choose tests that prove behavior obligations, not just command success. Record commands, evidence, gaps, and recovery recommendations.

## References

- Read `references/specdrive-output.md` when invoked by an adapter that requires structured execution output.
- Read `references/quality-loop.md` when this skill creates or updates Spec documents that must pass a review and repair loop before downstream use.

## Boundaries

- Do not rely on old dotted Skill names or compatibility aliases.
- Do not hardcode product-specific UI, database, scheduler, or adapter behavior unless the invocation supplies it as a source constraint.
- Surface missing decisions as `clarification_needed`, `review_needed`, `risk_review_needed`, or `blocked` instead of inventing facts.
