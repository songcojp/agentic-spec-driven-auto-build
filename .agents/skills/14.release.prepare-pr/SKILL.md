# PR Generation Skill

Use this skill after implementation, tests, and review have passed.

## Workflow

1. Inspect git status and confirm the intended diff belongs to the feature or task.
2. Stage only files that belong to the feature or task; preserve unrelated user changes.
3. Use a Conventional Commit message with a narrow scope and traceability when practical.
4. Push the feature branch to the configured remote.
5. Create a PR with summary, requirement/feature traceability, verification summary, risks, and follow-up items.
6. Do not include unrelated user changes.

## Output

- Commit hash.
- Branch and PR URL or creation failure summary.
- Verification summary.
- Delivery notes.

## Output Contract

- Follow `.agents/skills/SKILL_OUTPUT_CONTRACT.md` and return exactly one `SkillOutputContractV1` JSON object.
- `summary` must state whether the commit, push, and PR creation completed or where delivery stopped.
- `result` must follow the specialized contract below.

## Specialized Result Contract

`result` should contain:

- `commitHash`: created commit hash or `null`.
- `branchName`: pushed branch name or current delivery branch.
- `prUrl`: pull request URL or `null`.
- `verification`: array of checks run before delivery.
- `deliveryNotes`: concise release/PR notes and follow-ups.
- `blockedReason`: authentication, remote, permission, or policy blocker when applicable.

## Failure Routing

- Use `blocked` for authentication, remote, or network failures.
- Use `approval_needed` when protected branch, permission, or release policy blocks delivery.
