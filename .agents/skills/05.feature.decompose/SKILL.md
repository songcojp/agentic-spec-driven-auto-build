description: "Split product scope into implementation-ready Feature Specs and slice planned Feature Specs into executable tasks. Use when Codex is asked to decompose PRD, EARS requirements, and HLD into feature folders, dependencies, acceptance scope, or task graphs after planning context, architecture, data model, contract, and quickstart validation are available."

# Task Slicing Skill

This is the design-named entry point for Feature Spec decomposition and task graph generation.

## Workflow

1. Read the PRD, EARS requirements, project-level HLD, feature requirements, feature design, architecture plan, data model plan, contract plan, quickstart validation, and existing `tasks.md` if available.
2. Preserve source language unless the user asks otherwise.
3. **Organize by user story first**: read the `US-*` index from the requirements output (produced by `02.requirements.convert-ears`). If no `US-*` index exists, derive user stories from the PRD before grouping tasks. Each user story must be:
   - Tagged with its priority (`P1`, `P2`, `P3`).
   - Independently testable: implementing only this story must produce a verifiable, standalone behavior.
   - Mapped to its `REQ-*` requirements.
4. Group requirements by user value, workflow boundary, data ownership, implementation dependency, and risk.
5. Split vertically whenever possible: each feature should deliver a testable product behavior, not only a technical layer.
6. Keep shared platform or foundation work as its own feature only when multiple downstream features genuinely depend on it.
7. Assign stable feature IDs such as `FEAT-001`, `FEAT-002`, ... and map each to source `REQ-*`, `NFR-*`, `US-*`, and HLD sections.
8. Classify user-facing surfaces before drafting tasks. Any feature sourced from PRD/HLD words such as UI, page, Dashboard, Console, Workspace, Center, browser, frontend, interaction, or navigation is a UI-bearing feature.
9. If the split includes Project Initialization / 项目初始化 as the first Feature Spec, embed a `.gitignore` creation or safe-update requirement in that Feature Spec's `requirements.md`, `design.md`, and `tasks.md`. The generated requirement must say: create `.gitignore` when missing; when it exists, append only missing local runtime artifact ignore rules; never overwrite user content.
10. For each feature, define scope, non-scope, dependencies, acceptance, risks, and implementation tasks.
11. **Structure tasks by user story phase**: organize tasks into phases that mirror the user story priority order—Phase 1: shared setup (no story yet), Phase 2: P1 story tasks, Phase 3: P2 story tasks, Phase 4: P3 story tasks, Phase N: polish and cross-cutting. Each story phase must have an independent test checkpoint.
12. Create tasks that are independently reviewable, ordered by dependency, and tied to requirement IDs.
13. Assign expected files, allowed scope, required skill, subagent type, verification command, and done criteria.
14. Generate `tasks.md` with Webview-parseable task blocks that match `parseFeatureTasksMarkdown()` in `src/specdrive-ide.ts`, not compact single-line task bullets. Each task heading must use a stable parser-compatible task ID such as `T-001-01`, `T-021-12`, or `TASK-001`; do not generate compact IDs like `T001-01` even though the Webview can normalize them for legacy files. Each task block must include a standalone `状态:` or `Status:` line so the Feature Spec Webview can track status and compute task completion counts. New generated tasks must start as `状态: todo` unless the task is already completed from existing source evidence.
15. Write output to the requested location. If unspecified, create or update `docs/features/<feature-id>/requirements.md`, `design.md`, and `tasks.md`.
16. Always create or update the feature index table at `docs/features/README.md`. The index table MUST strictly use the following format: `| Feature ID | Status | Name | Milestone | Dependencies |`. A tree-structured dependency graph (树状依赖关系图) MUST be included to visualize the feature dependencies. This file is required by the downstream coding, testing, review, and PR generation skills.
17. Always create or update the machine-readable Feature Spec Pool queue plan at `docs/features/feature-pool-queue.json`. Code consumes this artifact to push Feature Specs into the Pool; do not rely on code parsing dependency prose from `README.md`.

## Feature Slicing Rules

- Prefer features that can be reviewed, tested, and delivered independently.
- Avoid slices that require editing every layer before any behavior can be validated.
- Keep one feature small enough for one focused implementation pass unless the PRD requires a larger milestone.
- Put risky unknowns early when they affect architecture, data model, security, or external integrations.
- Preserve traceability from feature to requirement to user story to design to task.
- Mark blocked or ambiguous features with open questions instead of hiding uncertainty.
- Project Initialization / 项目初始化 is a special foundation feature: when it is the first generated Feature Spec, it must include `.gitignore` creation or safe update as a concrete requirement, design constraint, task, and acceptance check for the target project.
- UI-bearing feature tasks must include visible pages or routes, data-bound components, loading/empty/error states, user action controls, and browser-level verification such as Playwright or equivalent runtime checks.
- API, ViewModel, schema, or unit-test tasks may support a UI-bearing feature, but they must not be the only completion tasks unless the feature explicitly says it is backend-only.
- Each P1 story phase must be completable and demoed without any P2/P3 tasks being done. An implementation that stops after P1 must still be a valid, usable baseline.

## Output

- Task graph or updated `tasks.md`, organized by user story phase (P1 → P2 → P3).
- `tasks.md` must preserve the current project-readable block structure and be parseable by the Feature Spec Webview task parser. Feature item task completion counts depend on the same parsed `id` and `status` fields, so use this shape for every task:
  ```md
  ### T-001-01 Task title
  状态: todo
  描述: Concrete implementation work.
  关联需求: REQ-001, US-001
  范围: Allowed files or modules.
  验证: Targeted command or acceptance check.
  完成标准: Observable done criteria.
  ```
  English-only projects may use `Status:`, `Description:`, and `Verification:`, but the task ID and status line are still mandatory. Do not use compact task rows such as `- T001-01: ... Requirements: ... Verification: ...` as the final generated format.
- Feature Spec Pool queue plan at `docs/features/feature-pool-queue.json` with `features[]` entries containing `id`, `priority`, and `dependencies`.
- User story to task mapping with independent-test checkpoint per story.
- Dependencies and parallelism constraints.
- Verification plan.
- Requirement, user story, and acceptance mapping.
- Return a `SkillOutputContractV1` JSON object with `contractVersion`, `executionId`, `skillSlug`, `requestedAction`, `status`, `summary`, `producedArtifacts`, and Feature-level `traceability`.

## Output Contract

- Follow `.agents/skills/SKILL_OUTPUT_CONTRACT.md` and return exactly one `SkillOutputContractV1` JSON object.
- The final assistant message must be only that JSON object. Do not return shorthand output with only `summary`, `status`, and `evidence`.
- Echo `contractVersion`, `executionId`, `skillSlug`, `requestedAction`, and `traceability.featureId` exactly from the invocation contract. Do not include `traceability.requirementIds`, `traceability.taskId`, `traceability.changeIds`, or other non-Feature tracking in the common Skill output contract.
- Every `producedArtifacts[]` entry must include `path`, `kind`, `status`, `checksum`, and `summary`; use `null` for `checksum` or `summary` when unavailable.
- `summary` must state the generated or updated Feature Specs, queue plan, dependencies, and verification plan readiness.
- `result` must follow the specialized contract below.

## Specialized Result Contract

`result` should contain:

- `features`: array of Feature IDs with name, status, milestone, dependencies, and primary requirements.
- `queuePlan`: `docs/features/feature-pool-queue.json` summary, including runnable order and blocked entries.
- `dependencyGraph`: dependency relationships and missing dependencies.
- `userStoryMapping`: mapping from `US-*` to Feature/task checkpoints.
- `verificationPlan`: commands or acceptance checks per feature/story phase.
- `openQuestions`: unsliced or blocked scope questions.

}
```

## Failure Routing

- Use `clarification_needed` for unsliceable scope or missing acceptance.
- Use `risk_review_needed` for tasks requiring broad refactors or risky shared changes.
